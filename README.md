Data description
Description of the data used to solve the problem and execute the solution.

The data we will need to solve our problem is information about where are the most hedge funds, or stock businesses, so that this cafe could be in a centralized location so that people relevant to this kind of restaurant can go easily. You can extract data from companies close by and restaurants doing well in that area. The data is more helpful with more parameters so we can also consider areas with high value.

Description of the methodology used to solve the problem.

For analyzing the neighborhoods of different cities we first find the neighborhood most popular places in Foursquare API and then for each neighborhood we analyze, we get the places that are closes to the investors offices. Then with the K-means algorithm we analyze this data and sort it so that it fits our model. The visualization of the neighborhood is done through the folium library.
